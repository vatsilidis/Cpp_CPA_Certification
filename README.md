# Cpp_CPA_Certification
This repo contain autonomous code snippets with classes for testing specific aspects for C++ language.

## Runing
Involving testing on variables, functions and classes of C++.
Some files are causing compilation errors in order to search and find what is causing the fault.

Is the code I was testing during the learning path at the CPA Certification studies at www.cppinstitute.org, trying to get to the CPA Certification.


## Workflow graph
It was a nice chance during the organizing in folders proccess to create a workflow graph, to experiment and also to show how a formal production graph appears in the Sourcetree Git tool.
This is what it holds the following screenshot during the graph creation.
